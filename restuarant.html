<p id="body-p">Well,you almost had me fooled.Told me i was nothing without you.Oh, but after everything you've done.I can thank you for how strong i've become.Insecure in her skin like a pearl pinned a girl on her skin.She's so gone thats so over now.You can look but you cant see the girl you used to know.Here i am .This is me,and i'm stronger than you ever thought i'd be.Are you shocked.Are you mad that your missing out in who i really am.Now it looks like the jokes on you 'cause the girl that you thought you knew.To be fair, the actual flavor isn't anything out of the ordinary, but drinking a festive, spring-themed drink with a bit of green food coloring certainly makes for a great pick-me-up.</p>

<p id="main-p">Dunkin's Shamrock Macchiato is definitely catered toward coffee-lovers, because the espresso flavor is far more intense than the green stuff, but even those who take their coffee sweet might want to add some sugar.  </p>

        <p><b>"</b> I order it again? Yes! The meal costs the same as it would à la carte (prices vary based on your location, though), so it's a win-win situation if you're a Saweetie fan with a big appetite.Overall, for me, it was the unexpected little details like the branded paper bag and sauce that made the experience exciting. But no matter which part tempts you, I suggest you place an order ASAP. After all, it's not every day that you can get a Saweetie-branded McDonald's meal — and that's pretty special in itself.<b>"</b> </p>

Aside from the packaging, one of the main appeals is the star's "remixed meals," which are three creative ways the rapper arranges and eats her McDonald's menu favorites.</p>
